## A `CLI`-based Employee System

This **repository** contains the source code for the 3rd assignment of the **course** "Object-Oriented Programming" (`DIT043`) offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (`CSE`) at the **University of Gothenburg** and the **Chalmers University of Technology**, Sweden ([link](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/object-oriented-programming-dit043)).

### Synopsis

The goal of this assignment was to put the `OOP` principles into practice by designing and implementing a `CLI`-based employee system. The system should be able to manage the employees of a company, including their personal information, their salary, and their working hours. The system should be scalable enough, such that we can continuously integrate new employee types into the system and so forth. What's more, the repository contains a set of unit tests that are used to verify the correctness of the implementation (see the `employeetests` under the `src` directory).
