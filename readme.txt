Group Work Assignment 3 - A3-Group 20
=====================================

WORK DIVISION
    We've decided to divide the work as follows: all three members have used a version control system,
    namely, Git, to manage, track the changes and distribute the work amongst the members. We decided 
    to work on the tasks concurrently for this assignment, using the Live Share extension in Visual Studio Code, 
    which allowed us to work on the same source code at the same time. We used Discord as a communication channel 
    so that we could discuss the tasks and the progress of the work in real time. Finally, the `main` branch 
    contains the source code made available to the CodeGrade platform.

    Linked repository:
        - https://github.com/michalspano/A3-G20

     Note: for the sake of discretion, the repository is private and can only be accessed by the members;
        however, the access may be granted upon request.

SPECIFIC TASK DIVISION

    Individual contributions:
        - Ionel: contribution to the Company.java class and the CustomExceptions sub-package alongside with the 
            other members. Created the Director sub-class of the Employee hierarchy; collective work on the 
            super-class Employee.java in a briefing session with the other members. Researched about alternative
            ways of instantiation of Collection objects, and implemented a so-called 'double-brace initialization' 
            via an anonymous inner class in the Utils.java class, in order to enhance readability. Creation of 
            individual components within the ExceptionThrower class. Worked on a class-diagram for the project
            using the Mermaid diagramming tool (not auto-generated!) for easier visualization of the class hierarchy. 

        - Joel: contribution to the Company.java class and the CustomExceptions sub-package alongside with the 
            other members. Created the Interns sub-class of the Employee hierarchy; collective work on the
            super-class Employee.java in a briefing session with the other members. Creation of 
            individual components within the ExceptionThrower class. Introduction of generalized behaviors
            within the Utils.java class, in order to enhance readability and re-usage of code. Reasoned about
            more efficient algorithmic approaches in various methods throughout the project.

        - Michal: contribution to the Company.java class and the CustomExceptions sub-package alongside with the 
            other members. Created the Manager sub-class of the Employee hierarchy; collective work on the 
            super-class Employee.java in a briefing session with the other members. Researched about alternative
            ways of instantiation of Collection objects, and implemented a so-called 'double-brace initialization' 
            via an anonymous inner class in the Utils.java class, in order to enhance readability. Creation of 
            individual components within the ExceptionThrower class. Proposed the use and implementation of the 
            factory method via the `EmployeeFactory` class. Handled the majority of the version control work regarding
            the management of the remote repository.
